# Todo-Listing-App
A todo-list app made with a python API (Django Rest Framework) with a basic React.js Front-end

In order to run the whole thing, you need to be sure you have both Node.js and Pipenv installed;

To use this app, first run the backend API:
Just access the backend/ folder and run:

`pipenv shell`

`python manage.py runserver`

Then, start the front-end local server:
Access the frontend/ folder on the root dir and run `npm start`
